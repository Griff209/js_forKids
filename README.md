# Inspired by JavaScript for Kids by Nick Morgan

# compliments.js
Chapter 3 of JavaScript for Kids culminates in several exercises built around an insult generator created throughout the chapter.
Not to be a wet blanket, but that is not the sort of thing I want to create, so I made a compliment generator instead. Rather than 
the recommended .join() method or concatenation via the + operator, I put compliments together using string interpolation. Simply 
run the function complimentGenerator() to see it in action, or open welcome.html in your favorite (modern) browser. 

# welcome.html
Chapters 9 and 10 of JavaScript for Kids introduce jQuery and interactive programming concepts, while chapter 13 introduces the canvas element. 
welcome.html uses a simple canvas element to draw a stick man, and uses jQuery to create a button that will call compliments.js. Note that 
compliments.js is included from this github repo, via the project by the good folks at https://rawgit.com/. 

# Future opportunities
JavaScript for Kids also dives into more advanced concepts around animation of DOM elements and user interaction with canvas elements. 
A waving stick man, allowing users to draw their own stick man, a walking stick man - these are all, in my mind, 
obvious next steps for the project.
